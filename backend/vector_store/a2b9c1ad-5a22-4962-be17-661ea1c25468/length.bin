Never mind that 'Slippery When Wet' was one of the biggest albums of the '80s. Strip away the big hair and the spandex! This is simply just a collection of rock-solid songs.

The hits on this disc are timeless. Just try to NOT sing along to Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name," "Livin' on a Prayer" or "Wanted Dead or Alive" â€” we dare you!
